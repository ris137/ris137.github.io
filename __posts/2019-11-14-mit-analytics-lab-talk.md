I had a great time speaking at the MIT Analytics Lab about some of my favorite ideas in natural language processing and their practical applications.

The talk built on top of my [explanations of the word2vec algorithm](/illustrated-word2vec/), and then [how embeddings are used to do product recommendations](http://127.0.0.1:4000/skipgram-recommender-talk/).

I demoed three basic Jupyter notebooks as hand-on practice:
 
 1. [Exploring Word Embeddings](https://github.com/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/nlp/01_Exploring_Word_Embeddings.ipynb) ([Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/nlp/01_Exploring_Word_Embeddings.ipynb))
 <br /> This notebook provides the quickest way to experiment with word embeddings, visualize them, and compare them.
 
 1. [Song Embeddings - Skipgram Recommender](https://github.com/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/nlp/02_Song_Embeddings.ipynb) ([Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/nlp/02_Song_Embeddings.ipynb))
  <br /> In this notebook, we train a word2vec model against song playlists to generate music recommendations.
  
 1. [Sentence Classification with BERT](https://github.com/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/nlp/03_Sentence_Classification_with_BERT.ipynb) ([Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/nlp/03_Sentence_Classification_with_BERT.ipynb))
 <br /> This notebook is a super fast way to use a pre-trained BERT model (using the wonderful [Huggingface transformers package](https://huggingface.co/)) use it for sentiment analysis.  I later expanded this in its own blog post - [A Visual Guide to Using BERT for the First Time](/a-visual-guide-to-using-bert-for-the-first-time/) with an update [notebook](https://github.com/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/bert/A_Visual_Notebook_to_Using_BERT_for_the_First_Time.ipynb) ([Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jalammar/jalammar.github.io/blob/master/notebooks/bert/A_Visual_Notebook_to_Using_BERT_for_the_First_Time.ipynb))
